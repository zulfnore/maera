## What is a **shell**?

Shells can be built as plugins and allow you to completely custom-code your own theme, overriding the default templates of the theme as well as its stylesheets and other scripts.  
The default templates of the theme already include a lot of hooks and actions you can use, allowing for a sane markup, SEO-optimization and easy to modify using a [shell macros](/docs/shells/macros/) file.  
If needed, you can override the default templates by [adding your own template views](/docs/shells/views/).
If you would like to learn more about Shells, you can read the docs below:
