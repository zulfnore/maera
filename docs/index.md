Maera is a WordPress theme framework that makes the lives of developers and designers easier.

It can be used to quickly and easily create sites and themes using "shells".  
It uses [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) as a templating engine instead of plain PHP, allowing non-PHP developers to understand the templates and build their own or tweak the existing ones when needed.
